### **Project Info**
- **Project Name:** - Fullstack web application for LittleLemon restaurant.
- **Project Description:** - This was my final project for the "The Full Stack" course of the [Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer). Both frontend and backend developed with Django.
- **Project Features:** - Table reservations can be made through the website and are stored in the MySQL database. The page renders and does not allow you to reselect schedules already reserved. The "reservations" tab renders a JSON with all the reservations already made.
The information on menu items is managed through Django admin, since they come from a MySQL table.
